Football Game Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing football (soccer) games using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from match videos, such as player movement tracking, ball trajectory, and camera motion estimation. By automating the analysis process, this tool helps coaches, analysts, and fans better understand game strategies, player performance, and team formations.

The system uses OpenCV, Python, and deep learning models for object detection and tracking. The pipeline includes frame extraction, camera motion estimation, homography transformations, and player position mapping on a 2D plane. This enables tactical analysis such as heatmaps, distance covered, and pass patterns.

Key Features:
Player and ball detection using YOLO/DeepSort
Camera motion and homography estimation
2D perspective transformation of field view
Visual analytics and movement paths
Technologies Used:
Python, OpenCV
NumPy, Matplotlib
Deep Learning (YOLOv5, DeepSORT, etc.)
Applications:
Tactical analysis
Performance tracking
Strategy planning
Broadcast enhancement
Future Work:
Integrate team detection
Real-time processing
Pass detection and goal probability metrics
